# Robot World

CRUD app built using sinatra. The app is a directory of robots. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. 
We can see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot. http://robohash.org/ was used for pictures. It has a dashboard that shows statistical data: average robot age, a breakdown of how many robots were hired each year, and number of robots in each department/city/state.
